/* This test file helps check for Sass deprecation warnings across all Spectre components.
It imports all three main Spectre SCSS files to trigger compilation of the entire codebase.

Run the test with:
  sass test/test.scss:dist/test.css

The compiler will show any warnings or errors found in any imported files.
The actual output CSS (dist/test.css) can be ignored - we only care about the warnings. */
